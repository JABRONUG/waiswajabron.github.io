 I am an enthusiastic HTML developer with a deep passion for creating clean, structured, and semantic web pages. My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how websites are built, and over time, I have specialized in crafting pages that are accessible, responsive, and visually appealing. HTML forms the backbone of my skill set, and I take pride in using it to build strong foundations for websites and applications.
